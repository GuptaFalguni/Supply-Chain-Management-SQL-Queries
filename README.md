# Supply-Chain-Management-SQL-Queries

This project involves writing SQL queries for a fictional company's supply chain management system. The dataset includes customer orders, products, suppliers, and order details. The SQL queries are designed to help the company’s sales and marketing department analyze the performance of products, suppliers, and customer purchasing behavior. The data structure includes five interconnected tables: customer, orders, orderitem, supplier, and product.

## Problem Statement
The company needs insights into its supply chain data to optimize its sales and marketing strategies. The key problems addressed by this project include:

- Identifying high-demand products and suppliers.
- Analyzing customer order patterns to understand repeat business frequency.
- Calculating total revenue and total sales by each supplier.
- Finding dependency of the UK on other countries for product supply.
- Providing competitor insights for a new supplier entering the market.
  
The project addresses these problems by performing the following:

- **Customer Analysis:** Understanding customer order frequency and identifying which customers have placed no orders or very few orders.
- **Product & Supplier Analysis:** Identifying high-demand products, costliest items ordered, and top suppliers in terms of sales.
- **Revenue and Discounts:** Calculating the total revenue generated and identifying how much money was saved in each order due to discounts.
- **Geographical Insights:** Finding out which country has the maximum suppliers, and understanding UK’s dependency on other countries for supply.

## Files Included
- **Supply_chain_ER_Diagram.png:** Visual representation of the database schema, outlining relationships between tables (customer, orders, orderitem, supplier, and product).
- **SupplyChain_Questions.docx:** Contains SQL query-related questions focused on data extraction, business analysis, and advanced challenges like competitor analysis and customer order patterns.
- **Supply_chain_SQL_Querry.docx:** Provides SQL queries answering the questions from the SupplyChain_Questions.docx, addressing key business problems and data insights.
